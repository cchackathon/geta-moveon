Georgia Tech College of Computing Make A Difference Hackathon

The Make A Difference Hackathon is a 24-hour collegiate hackathon at the Georgia Tech College of Computing.  We believe technology has the power to spark positive change in our communities. Our mission is to empower and enrich humanity.  We gather undergraduate students of all backgrounds to bridge the gap between technology and social advocacy in hopes to inspire individuals to build creative tools that can be used to tackle society's biggest issues. Our community welcomes everyone, including all levels of programming skills. We encourage all students to join, as there will be mentors to help teach you about new technologies.

The hackathon will start at 11 AM on Saturday, January 27th and will run until 2 PM on Sunday, January 28th. It will take place in the Klaus Atrium. We will provice dinner, a midnight snack, and breakfast; as well as coffee and snacks throughout the event.
